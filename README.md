# queens

This repository aims at two purpose: solving the 8(n) queens problem and display the process using tkinter.
The first task seems to be the harder one, but infact it only requires one to truly understand the relationship between chesses and board.
The second one, on the other hand, involves different aspects of visual presentation and many small steps that do add up.

Currently, I have present my solution to the first problem while the other one is still in work.
This repository consists of two notebooks. File "queen" is the still-in-work notebook for Tkinter board visualisation. File "qsolver" is the notebook for solving eight queens problem. The latter is only for eight queens not for n-queens, but one can see that the deriving is not that hard.
